    <div class="overwrite" style="color: white;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Computer Science Department's Works</div>
    <p style="  margin-top:3%;">The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) was established 
      in the year 1996 along with the inception of the college. The primary objective of this department is 
      to provide a high quality computer science education to students from all over India as well as abroad
       and across all economic strata. The department offers an undergraduate degree program B.E(CSE) and 
       a postgraduate degree program M.E(CSE). In 2006, the department was recognized as a Centre for 
       Research, by Anna University to offer a Ph.D. program. </p>

      <p>The undergraduate program B.E (CSE) has been accredited by NBA in 2015 for five years, for the third 
        time. The postgraduate program M.E (CSE) has been accredited by NBA in 2016 for five years for the 
        second time. The department has state-of-the-art laboratory facilities, Wi-Fi enabled class rooms 
        with laptops and overhead projectors to facilitate e-Learning, a well-equipped seminar hall and a
