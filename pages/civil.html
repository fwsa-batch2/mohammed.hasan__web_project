        <div class="overwrite" style="color: white;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil Engineering Department's Works</div>
        <p style="  margin-top:3%;">Civil Engineering is a branch of engineering involved in the conceptualization,
            planning, design, construction and operation of systems, facilities and infrastructure needed for
            maintaining and supporting modern civilization. It is the oldest and broadest of the divisions of
            ngineering which implements a range of public and private projects for improving society’s physical
            infrastructure and the environment. A civil engineer integrates scientific principles with
            engineering experience to plan, design, and construct networks of highways and railroads, airports,
            bridges and dams, environmental pollution control systems, industrial structures, water purification
            and distribution systems, and urban transportation systems that maintain, protect, and enhance the
            quality of life. He or she is also into understanding the geology and plate tectonics, which helps
            in classifying the land with respect to earthquakes. The Civil Engineering course trains a student
            in fundamental subjects like mathematics, physics and chemistry as well as essentials of other
            streams of engineering, making him ready to be the builder of the modern world.</p>

        <p> The Department of Civil Engineering was started in the academic year 2011-12 with an aim of promoting
            high-quality
            education in the field of Civil Engineering. The department has well-equipped laboratory facilities
            and highly qualified faculty members having rich experience in teaching and industrial background.
            The department is aiming to transform itself into a centre of excellence both in academic and
            research. The department provides the right kind of environment for the students to groom
            themselves for innovative and challenging near future. It is also actively engaged in cutting edge research,
            trying to find simple and cost-effective solutions for the construction industry and society as a whole. The
            department is aiming to transform itself into a centre of excellence, both in academics as well as research.
            The department takes the best possible efforts to provide its students with the right kind of ambience for
            their holistic development into future pillars of the nation and society.</p>

           <p>Our graduates are currently in employment with companies of national and international repute. We also have
            a rich heritage of students pursuing higher studies in prestigious institutions and universities, both in
            India and abroad.</p>

            <p>The Department of Civil Engineering have signed MoU with various organisations to foster industry-institute
            interaction and provide practically relevant skills to the students and placement opportunities.
            The department currently offers post-doctoral fellowships to eligible candidates in various areas.
            Interested candidates can contact the HOD to know further details.</p>
