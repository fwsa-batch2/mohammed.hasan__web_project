            <u style="font-size:30px;">Divisions of our University</u><br /><br> In 2001, under the TEN DOTS University Amendment Act of 2001, the erstwhile TEN DOTS University became an affiliating university, taking under its wings all the engineering
            colleges in Tamil Nadu. This included six government engineering colleges, three government-aided private institutions, and 426 self-financing colleges. On 1 February 2007.The institutes were formally created in 2010. On 14 September 2011,
            a bill was passed to merge back the universities.The merger became final in August 2012.In 2011 and 2012 the constituents were merged back to a single affiliating university and the four regional universities continue to function as regional
            campus of the university.<br/>
            <u style="font-size:30px;">Exam Processes</u><br /><br> A common entrance test – the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examination (TNPCEE) – was used as a basis for admission to professional courses in the state until 2006.Starting
            in the academic year 2007–08, students were admitted to engineering colleges on the basis of their higher secondary marks.Post-graduate admission process is carried out through TANCET and GATE scores.Academic.The university offers courses
            in engineering and technology through its affiliated colleges and follows a dual semester system. Every year the university conducts examinations for even semester in May–June and for odd semester in November–December. The first semester students
            have exams in January.
